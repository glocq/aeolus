// The `Plugin` trait requires our `Aeolus` type to implement `Send`. It does not automatically do so
// because it contains a `Pitch` field, which contains a raw pointer (see [1]).
// From what I understand, this page [2] suggests that it's okay to implement `Send`
// for a type that contains raw pointers, you just have to trust the (aubio-rs) library author...
// which I do, otherwise I wouldn't be using the library?
// I may have misunderstood something here, but this unsafe implementation is the only way forward
// that I see, so I'll go with it and wait to see if something goes wrong.
